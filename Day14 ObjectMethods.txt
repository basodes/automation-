Object Definitions:-
=========================

An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc.

State: represents the data (value) of an object.
Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object.



1. An object is a real-world entity.
2. An object is a runtime entity.
3. The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
4. The object is an instance of a class.



new keyword in Java:-
=========================
The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. 
All objects get memory in Heap memory area.




Methods in Java:-
=====================================
1. Regular Method  (Written in Business logic classes)
2. Main Method ( To execute the main class)

Regular Method further divied into two types:-

1.Static Method.
2.Non Static Method.

// Method Writing:-

1. Access Specifier
2. data return type
3. Method Name (Parameters List if required)
4. Curly brackets.

Static Method:- Static methods are the methods in Java that can be called without creating an object of class. 
They are referenced by the class name itself. 

Calling Static Method:- 
Class Name. Method Name

Non Static Method:- A non-static method in Java does not have the key word 'static' before the name of the method. 
A non-static method belongs to an object of the class, and you have to create an instance of the class to access the non-static method.

Calling Non Static Method:- 

Creating Class Object
Object Name. Method Name


It may possible that a method returns a value or may not returns a value.
If method doesnot return any value then returntype will be void.
If method returns a value then last statement will be return statement.
The code written after return statement will be unreachable.

// Program==> Methods Call from same class.


public class Demo {

	// Methods to call from same classs.
	// 2 static methods 2 nonstatic 
	// call them.
	
	
	public static void test1() {
		System.out.println("This is Method one - static");
	}
	
	public static void test2() {
		System.out.println("This is Method Two- static");
	}
	
	public void test3() {
		System.out.println("This is Method Three- Nonstatic");
	}
	
	public void test4() {
		System.out.println("This is Method four- Nonstatic");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		System.out.println("Main method starts");
		
		// static method calling.
		Demo.test1();
		Demo.test2();
		
		// Non static method calling
		
		Demo d1= new Demo();  // declaration of an object
		d1.test3();
		d1.test4();
		
		Demo.test1();
		Demo.test1();
		Demo.test1();
		System.out.println("Main Method Ends");
		
	}
