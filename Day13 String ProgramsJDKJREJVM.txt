JDK/JRE/JVM Architecture
=============================================================================

1. JDK (Java Development Kit) is a Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program. 
JDK is a kit(or package) that includes two things

==>Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
==>JRE (to execute your java program).

Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. 
It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed in Java development.

The main function is to compile the java class and execute it.

2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment to only run(not develop) 
the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only want to run Java programs
that are end-users of your system.

JRE stands for “Java Runtime Environment”.
The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application.
it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files. 
It also contains the runtime liabraries to execute the code.


3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.
 Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line,
 hence it is also known as an interpreter.

It is a virtual Machine. We cant see it as jdk and jre which is available in c drive.
