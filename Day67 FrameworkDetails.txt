Framework:- 
=================================================================================================================

==> Framework is define the set of rules or practices which we can allow in systematic way to achieve the desired results.

==> Major Frameworks in Selenium.
	1. Data Driven Testing Framework
	2. Keyword Driven Testing Framework
	3. Hybrid Testing Framework


==> Data Driven Testing Framework
=====================================================================================================================
1. Data driven testing framework majorly work on seprating the test logic and test data from each other.
2. It allows us to create the test automation scripts by passing the different sets of test data.
3. The test data is kept in external files or resources such as MS excel sheets or xml files etc.
4. The test scripts connects to the external resources to get the test data.
5. This framework reduces the test scripts compared to the other frameworks.
6. This framework will give more test coverage with reusable test and flexibility in execution of tests whenever required.
7. This framework has only one drawback that it need the skilled tester in terms of coading/ programming knowledge.

==> Keyword Driven Testing Framework
=====================================================================================================================

1. It is also known as table driven testing or action word based Testing.
2. In Keyword driven testing we use table format to define keyword  or action words for each function or method that we want to execte.
3. It performs the automation test scripts based on the keywords specified in the excel sheet. 	
4. By using this framework testers can work with keywords to develop any test automation script.
5. Testers with less automation knowledge can also work on this framework.
6. The logic to read the keyword and call the required action methods in the excel sheet is placed in the main class.
7. Working with this framework is bit easy but initial set up is requies more expertise.

==> Hybrid Testing Framework
=====================================================================================================================

1. It contains combination of multiple approaches to write the test scripts.
2. It contains combination of Data driven testing framework and keyword driven testing framework.
3. This framework captures all good things from indivisual framework and combine it to use.
4. It gives more flexibilty but it requires a tester with versatile knowledge. 
5. Maintainance is quite difficult.
