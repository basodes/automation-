Application Types:- 
1. Web Based
2. Desktop Based/Window Based
3. Mobile Application.

Challenges in Manual Testing.
1. Re- Testing    ==> Testing the application with different set of test data
2. Regression Testing ==> Testing the impact of newly developed functionality on old functionality.


How Automation Tool Works

Manual Tester==> Testcase ==> Check the Application

Automation Tester==> TestScripts (using java in selenium)  ==> Check the Application


• What is selenium? 

Selenium
 Selenium is web based automation tool
 Selenium is open Source.(Free)
 Selenium has multiple components (IDE, RC, Web driver, Grid)

• Advantages of Selenium 

Advantages:-
It is open source tool.
It supports multiple operating systems. (Windows/Mac/Linux etc.)
It supports multiple Languages (java, python, C#, Ruby)
It can integrate with third party tools. (Apache Poi, Auto IT, Sikuli, Extent Reporter)


• Disadvantages/Limitations of Selenium 

It cannot automate Windows/Desktop based application (Auto IT, Sikuli)
Reporting System is not available directly. (TestNG, Extent Reporter)
Not Supporting Access to excel files directly (Apache Poi)
Graphs are not generated.
Selenium doesnot support to captcha.
Selenium doesnot support to file uploading and downloading.

• Selenium Versions

Selenium 1.X  IDE (Firefox), RC, Grid ==> Selenium IDE
Selenium 2.X  IDE (Firefox), Web driver, Grid ==> Selenium RC
Selenium 3.X  IDE (Multiple), Web driver, Grid ==> Selenium Webdriver.
